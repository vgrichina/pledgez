h1. Pledgez - concise BDD framework for Groovy

h2. Intro

Pledgez is a "behavior driven development":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development framework for Groovy,
which aims for tests syntax to be as concise as possible.

It is -stolen from- heavily inspired by "Vows":http://vowsjs.org. However Groovy actually allows for more concise syntax.

h2. Sample

Usage of Pledgez is very simple. Here's an example ported from Vows.

<pre><code>
import com.componentix.pledgez.Pledges

Pledges.describe("Division By Zero").addBatch([
    "when dividing a number by zero": [
        topic: { 42f / 0f },

        "we get Infinity": { it == Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY }
    ],
    "but when dividing zero by zero": [
        topic: { 0f / 0f },

        "we get a value which": [
            "is not a number": { it.isNaN() },
            // This is not true in Groovy and so will fail
            "is not equal to itself": { it != it }
        ]
    ]
]).run()
</code></pre>
